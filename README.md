# Modelfiles

This repository contains a personal collection of model files that have been used during my LLM experimentation. For my use case, I create and use the models using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). 

[Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) is also used to provide a graphical interface for interacting with the models. 

Finally, since VS-Code is one of my go-to editors for development, I also use [Continue](https://docs.continue.dev/getting-started/overview/) VS-Code extension to interact with the models from there.

This setup can ensure the deployment of LLMs locally on proprietary servers, which may be a mandatory security constraint for some applications.
